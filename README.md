Funny game of football

This game wanna be a kind of tutorial for a real game using just basic libraries.

I'm going to use c++14/17/1z as much as I can.

Libraries that I've used:
  * `SDL2`: platform indipendent library for creating window and managin events. I've choose this library because is possible use with Android;
  * `gl3w`: utilized for loading OpenGL 3+ extensions;
  * `dear-imgui`: Awesome library for User Interface;
  * `Eigen`: awesome library for geometry;
  * `boost::asio`: for networking and aasync I/O
  * `gsl`: Guideline Support Library
  * `range-v3`: awesome library for functional programming.
